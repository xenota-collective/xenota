# Xenota Crew: Starshot

This repository is the Xenota `crew/starshot` workspace.

- Follow `AGENTS.md` in this repo as the source of truth for workflow and landing rules.
- Use `bd` for issue tracking and keep handbook sync work aligned to implemented xenon behavior.
- Keep docs and code changes scoped to Xenota concerns; avoid unrelated rig-specific instructions.
