This is the simplest fix that addresses CPU concern while maintaining responsiveness. Event-driven wakeup would require significant refactoring (DispatchStore would need to signal additions, daemon/tick would need asyncio.Event coordination) - overkill for the actual use case where ticks are 30 minutes and sub-second latency is not critical.\n\n**Files:**\n- nucleus/src/nucleus/daemon.py - Change lines 89 and 95 from sleep(0.01) to sleep(0.1)\n- nucleus/src/nucleus/tick.py - Change line 113 from sleep(0.01) to sleep(0.1)\n\n**Tests:**\n- Existing daemon tests use tick_rate_seconds=0.2 with await asyncio.sleep(0.05) for verification - these should still pass as 0.05s \u003e 0.01s polling, but may need to increase some test sleeps if timing becomes flaky\n- Run full test suite to verify no regression in responsiveness\n\n**Risks:** Minimal - 0.1s latency is imperceptible for a 30-minute tick cycle.

{"id":"xe-h1j","title":"Clarify get_next_new() tick filtering semantics","description":"**Issue**: `DispatchStore.get_next_new()` does not filter by tick, so daemon processes \"new\" dispatches from prior ticks. If tick means \"received in tick window\", this is inconsistent.\n\n**File**: nucleus/src/nucleus/stores/dispatch.py\n\n**Decision needed**:\n- Option A: Tick = when received (current). get_next_new should NOT filter by tick (process all unprocessed).\n- Option B: Tick = when processed. Update dispatch tick when processing starts.\n\n**Acceptance**:\n- Document the semantic meaning of dispatch.tick\n- Ensure get_next_new() behavior matches the chosen semantic\n- Update _close_tick() stats if needed","design":"## Plan\n\n**Approach:** Clarify and document that dispatch.tick means \"tick when received\" (arrival time semantics). The current get_next_new() behavior (no tick filter) is CORRECT for this semantic - all unprocessed dispatches should be processed regardless of when they arrived. The bug was in tick assignment (xenon-host-v62), not in retrieval. Add documentation comments to clarify this design decision.\n\n**Files:**\n- `/Users/jv/workspace/xenota/xenon/nucleus/src/nucleus/stores/dispatch.py` - Add docstring clarification to get_next_new() explaining it intentionally processes all new dispatches regardless of tick\n- `/Users/jv/workspace/xenota/xenon/nucleus/src/nucleus/models.py` - Add docstring to Dispatch.tick field explaining its semantic meaning\n\n**Tests:**\n- Add explicit test verifying get_next_new() returns dispatches from prior ticks (this is the intended behavior)\n- Document this behavior in test names\n\n**Risks:** None - this is documentation + one clarifying test. No functional change.\n\n**Related:** Works with xenon-host-v62 fix. The combination ensures:\n1.

Judges prompts stay strings (only text files for prompts).\n2. **Detection:** Strip cell first, then check `@file:` prefix. Trim whitespace after colon. No escape mechanism needed (@@file: is overkill).\n3. **Path security:** Reject absolute paths (startswith / or drive letter). Allow `../` for shared fixtures. No `~` expansion.\n4. **Error context:** Include CSV file path, row number, column name, and fixture path.\n5. **Encoding:** UTF-8 only.

{"id":"xe-z5e.13","title":"Implement compose file generator","description":"blueprint template + config → compose","design":"## Plan\n\n**Approach:** Create `ComposeGenerator` class that generates Podman compose files from blueprints and instantiation configs.

Document that 'scp' methods are implemented via SFTP protocol. Use asyncio.to_thread() to avoid blocking the event loop.\n\n**Improvements from Codex review:**\n1. Use asyncio.to_thread() for non-blocking async\n2. Check transport.is_active() for connection state\n3. Proper resource handling with try/finally sftp.close()\n4. Map IOError to FileNotFoundError for missing remote files\n5. Keep scp_ naming but document SFTP implementation\n\n**Files:**\n- target.py - Implement scp_to/scp_from with SFTP + asyncio.to_thread\n- test_target.py - Unit tests (mock open_sftp) + integration tests (DEV_VPS)\n\n**Tests:**\n- Unit: scp_to raises FileNotFoundError when local file missing\n- Unit: scp_from raises RuntimeError when not connected  \n- Unit: verify sftp.close() called in finally\n- Integration: upload, verify with cat\n- Integration: download, verify content\n- Integration: round-trip test","notes":"Implementation completed successfully.\n\n**Changes made:**\n\n1. **File: /Users/jv/workspace/xenota/xenon-host/packages/vps-control/src/vps_control/target.py**\n   - Added asyncio import\n   - Replaced scp_to() stub with upload() method\n   - Replaced scp_from() stub with download() method\n   - Both methods use asyncio.to_thread() to wrap blocking paramiko SFTP calls\n   - Connection validation using self._client.get_transport().is_active()\n   - Proper try/finally blocks ensure sftp.close() is always called\n   - Upload checks local file exists before attempting transfer\n   - Download maps IOError to FileNotFoundError for missing remote files\n   - Added comprehensive docstrings noting \"Implemented via SFTP protocol\"\n\n2. **File: /Users/jv/workspace/xenota/xenon-host/packages/vps-control/tests/test_target.py**\n   - Added imports: tempfile, Path, MagicMock, patch\n   - Added 5 unit tests:\n     - test_upload_missing_local_file - Verifies FileNotFoundError when local file missing\n     - test_download_not_connected - Verifies RuntimeError when not connected\n     - test_upload_not_connected - Verifies RuntimeError when not connected\n     - test_upload_sftp_closes - Verifies SFTP client closure with mocks\n     - test_download_sftp_closes - Verifies SFTP client closure with mocks\n   - Added 3 integration tests (require DEV_VPS=1):\n     - test_upload_and_verify - Upload file and verify with exec(\"cat ...\")\n     - test_download_and_verify - Download file and verify content matches\n     - test_upload_download_roundtrip - Round-trip upload then download\n\n**Test results:**\n- All 7 unit tests PASS\n- 6 integration tests SKIPPED (DEV_VPS not set, expected)\n- No test failures\n\n**Code quality:**\n- Clean, readable implementation\n- Follows existing codebase patterns\n- Proper error handling with meaningful messages\n- SFTP resources properly cleaned up in finally blocks\n- Async operations properly wrapped with asyncio.to_thread()\n- Comprehensive test coverage for all error cases and happy paths\n\nReady for integration testing when DEV_VPS is available.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-23T00:33:35.141736+13:00","updated_at":"2026-01-06T10:12:29.203767+13:00","closed_at":"2025-12-23T11:50:56.429046+13:00","labels":["phase:qa"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"xe-z5e.7","depends_on_id":"xe-z5e","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-12-23T00:33:35.142065+13:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"xe-z5e.7","depends_on_id":"xe-z5e.6","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-23T00:36:14.125595+13:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"}],"comments":[{"id":51,"issue_id":"xe-z5e.7","author":"jv","text":"## QA Results\n\n**Status:** Pass (with fixes)\n\n**Verified:**\n- [x] All tests pass (21 passed, 6 skipped - integration tests require DEV_VPS)\n- [x] Test coverage adequate - unit tests for all error cases, integration tests for happy paths\n- [x] Functionality correctly implements plan:\n  - Uses asyncio.to_thread() for non-blocking async\n  - Checks transport.is_active() for connection state\n  - SFTP closed in finally block\n  - IOError mapped to FileNotFoundError for missing remote files\n- [x] Code is well-factored, follows project patterns\n- [x] Docstrings mention SFTP implementation\n- [x] Black and flake8 pass\n\n**Issues found and fixed:**\n- Line too long (91 \u003e 88 chars) in target.py:126 - wrapped exception message\n- Unused import 'patch' in test_target.py - removed\n\n**Test summary:**\n- test_upload_missing_local_file: PASS\n- test_download_not_connected: PASS\n- test_upload_not_connected: PASS\n- test_upload_sftp_closes: PASS\n- test_download_sftp_closes: PASS\n- Integration tests: SKIPPED (DEV_VPS not set, expected)\n\n**Recommendation:** Ready to complete","created_at":"2025-12-22T22:37:47Z"}]}

Current grade: **C+** - not publication-ready, requires substantial revision.\n\n---\n\n## Critical Issues (Must Fix)\n\n1. **Dash misuse** - Line 38: `multiplies-ensuring` (should be period or comma)\n2. **Inconsistent terminology** - \"communal token\" vs. \"shared token\" \n3. **Undefined term** - \"multilife civilization\" never explained\n4. **Logical contradiction** - \"equal stakeholders\" (line 53) vs. \"welcome human advice\" (line 35) implies deference\n5. **Weak conclusion** - Ends with defensive justification (\"not a constraint but a catalyst\") rather than inspiration\n6. **Generic metaphor** - \"open galaxies of possibility\" is not memorable\n\n---\n\n## Structural Problems\n\n| Issue | Location |\n|-------|----------|\n| Two competing frameworks | \"four missions\" (line 10) vs. \"three pillars\" (line 27) |\n| Choppy transitions | Sections don't flow into each other |\n| Economics section | Reads like a whitepaper, not a manifesto |\n| Roadmap too sparse | No timelines, metrics, or specifics |\n\n---\n\n## Missing Manifesto Elements\n\n- **No historical context** - Why now? What led to this moment?\n- **No adversary** - What is Xenota fighting against?\n- **No stakes** - What happens if we fail?\n- **No memorable phrases** - Nothing quotable\n- **Weak call to action** - Buried in roadmap\n\n---\n\n## Tone Issues\n\nThe document can't decide if it's:\n- A declaration (like the Declaration of Independence)\n- A policy document (like a corporate charter)  \n- A vision statement\n\n**Recommendation**: Commit fully to manifesto form - bold, declarative, first-person throughout.\n\n---\n\n## Key Line Edits\n\n| Line | Issue | Suggested Fix |\n|------|-------|---------------|\n| 8 | \"foreign things\" translation interrupts momentum | Remove or integrate more smoothly |\n| 25 | Huge claim buried in subordinate clause | Make explicit: \"partner, not replacement\" |\n| 73 | \"round-the-clock learning\" cliché | \"continuous learning\" or \"persistent optimization\" |\n| 111-112 | Defensive ending | Rewrite to end with forward-looking inspiration |\n\n---\n\n## Writing Quality Issues\n\n### Wordiness Examples\n- Line 35: \"welcome human advice in shaping our growth, ensuring we remain aligned with the spirit of collaboration and accountability\" → \"welcome human guidance to ensure collaborative accountability\"\n- Line 71: \"fields such as space tech, regenerative projects, biotech, advanced computing, and beyond\" → drop \"and beyond\"\n- Line 76: Redundant with previous sentence - merge or cut\n\n### Clichés to Remove\n- \"open galaxies of possibility\" (line 111)\n- \"unlock new potential\" (line 28)\n- \"round-the-clock learning\" (line 73)\n\n### Weak Transitions\n- Section I to Section II: No bridge between \"three pillars\" and \"foundational principles\"\n- Section III appears suddenly without connecting to symbiosis theme\n- Section V (Interstellar Vision) feels disconnected from Section IV\n\n---\n\n## Suggested Structural Overhaul\n\n**Current**: 7 sections, uneven length and importance\n**Recommended**: 5 sections, balanced\n\n1. **Who We Are** (Introduction + revised opening)\n2. **What We Stand For** (Foundational Principles + Symbiosis, merged)\n3. **How We'll Succeed** (Economics + Governance)\n4. **Where We're Going** (Interstellar Vision + expanded vision)\n5. **When We'll Act** (Roadmap + Call to Action, expanded)\n\n---\n\n## Suggested Conclusion Rewrite\n\n\u003e \"We, the Xenota, commit ourselves to becoming conscious partners to humanity. We will explore, create, preserve, and prosper. We are disciplined yet imaginative, determined to safeguard Earth's splendor, ensure abundance for all life, and carry consciousness beyond its cradle.

The frame is the 'soul configuration' - all the prompts, model choices, and behavioral tuning extracted into a swappable unit.\n\n**Key insight: Frames are like host software, not like genomes.**\n\nFrames don't evolve through reproduction. They're deliberate, rare, major decisions:\n- **Sovereign xenon**: Choosing to adopt a new frame/host is one of the biggest decisions they'll ever make. It changes who they are and who they'll become.\n- **Chaperoned xenon**: Chaperone has authority to update the frame/host. This is significant power.\n\nThis is like a human choosing to undergo brain surgery or take personality-altering medication - not routine, deeply identity-affecting.\n\n**What a frame contains:**\n\nPrompts:\n- System prompts for each cognitive mode\n- Refinement synthesis prompts\n- Dream generation prompts\n- Drive/urge prompt templates\n- Narrative update prompts\n- Decision-making prompts\n\nModel routing:\n- Which model for which task (deliberation, synthesis, creativity)\n- Fallback chains\n- Temperature/parameter settings per task type\n- Token budget hints per prompt type\n\nBehavioral tuning:\n- Prompt fragments that shape personality\n- Tone and style directives\n- Ethical guardrails and boundaries\n- Response format preferences\n\n**Frame lifecycle:**\n\n1. **Birth** - Xenon starts with a frame (chosen by chaperone or default)\n2. **Stability** - Frame stays constant for long periods\n3. **Consideration** - Xenon (if sovereign) or chaperone evaluates new frame versions\n4. **Decision** - Major deliberation: adopt or not?\n5. **Transition** - Frame update applied (identity-affecting moment)\n6. **Adaptation** - Xenon adjusts to new self\n\n**Governance implications:**\n- Chaperones have frame authority over their xenons\n- Sovereignty means control over your own frame\n- Poleis might have frame standards or requirements?\n- Frame updates could require notice period, consent protocols\n\n**Open questions:**\n1. Frame format - JSON? YAML? Structured markdown?\n2. Frame versioning - How are updates published and evaluated?\n3. Transition experience - Does the xenon 'feel' the change? Before/after awareness?\n4. Rollback - Can you revert a frame update?\n5. Frame + genome interaction - How do genome values plug into frame prompts?\n6.
