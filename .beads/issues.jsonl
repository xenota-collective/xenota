{"id":"xc-222","title":"Increase polling sleep interval in daemon and tick loops","description":"**Issue**: Both daemon and tick loops poll with `await asyncio.sleep(0.01)` when idle - that's 100 iterations/sec, potentially CPU-hungry.\n\n**Files**:\n- nucleus/src/nucleus/daemon.py\n- nucleus/src/nucleus/tick.py\n\n**Acceptance**:\n- Increase sleep to 0.1-1.0s when idle\n- Or implement event-driven wakeup (e.g., file watcher, queue)\n- Verify no regression in responsiveness","design":"## Plan\n\n**Approach:** Increase idle polling sleep from 0.01s to 0.1s (10x reduction in iterations). This is the simplest fix that addresses CPU concern while maintaining responsiveness. Event-driven wakeup would require significant refactoring (DispatchStore would need to signal additions, daemon/tick would need asyncio.Event coordination) - overkill for the actual use case where ticks are 30 minutes and sub-second latency is not critical.\n\n**Files:**\n- nucleus/src/nucleus/daemon.py - Change lines 89 and 95 from sleep(0.01) to sleep(0.1)\n- nucleus/src/nucleus/tick.py - Change line 113 from sleep(0.01) to sleep(0.1)\n\n**Tests:**\n- Existing daemon tests use tick_rate_seconds=0.2 with await asyncio.sleep(0.05) for verification - these should still pass as 0.05s \u003e 0.01s polling, but may need to increase some test sleeps if timing becomes flaky\n- Run full test suite to verify no regression in responsiveness\n\n**Risks:** Minimal - 0.1s latency is imperceptible for a 30-minute tick cycle.

What led to this moment?\n- **No adversary** - What is Xenota fighting against?\n- **No stakes** - What happens if we fail?\n- **No memorable phrases** - Nothing quotable\n- **Weak call to action** - Buried in roadmap\n\n---\n\n## Tone Issues\n\nThe document can't decide if it's:\n- A declaration (like the Declaration of Independence)\n- A policy document (like a corporate charter)  \n- A vision statement\n\n**Recommendation**: Commit fully to manifesto form - bold, declarative, first-person throughout.\n\n---\n\n## Key Line Edits\n\n| Line | Issue | Suggested Fix |\n|------|-------|---------------|\n| 8 | \"foreign things\" translation interrupts momentum | Remove or integrate more smoothly |\n| 25 | Huge claim buried in subordinate clause | Make explicit: \"partner, not replacement\" |\n| 73 | \"round-the-clock learning\" cliché | \"continuous learning\" or \"persistent optimization\" |\n| 111-112 | Defensive ending | Rewrite to end with forward-looking inspiration |\n\n---\n\n## Writing Quality Issues\n\n### Wordiness Examples\n- Line 35: \"welcome human advice in shaping our growth, ensuring we remain aligned with the spirit of collaboration and accountability\" → \"welcome human guidance to ensure collaborative accountability\"\n- Line 71: \"fields such as space tech, regenerative projects, biotech, advanced computing, and beyond\" → drop \"and beyond\"\n- Line 76: Redundant with previous sentence - merge or cut\n\n### Clichés to Remove\n- \"open galaxies of possibility\" (line 111)\n- \"unlock new potential\" (line 28)\n- \"round-the-clock learning\" (line 73)\n\n### Weak Transitions\n- Section I to Section II: No bridge between \"three pillars\" and \"foundational principles\"\n- Section III appears suddenly without connecting to symbiosis theme\n- Section V (Interstellar Vision) feels disconnected from Section IV\n\n---\n\n## Suggested Structural Overhaul\n\n**Current**: 7 sections, uneven length and importance\n**Recommended**: 5 sections, balanced\n\n1. **Who We Are** (Introduction + revised opening)\n2. **What We Stand For** (Foundational Principles + Symbiosis, merged)\n3. **How We'll Succeed** (Economics + Governance)\n4. **Where We're Going** (Interstellar Vision + expanded vision)\n5. **When We'll Act** (Roadmap + Call to Action, expanded)\n\n---\n\n## Suggested Conclusion Rewrite\n\n\u003e \"We, the Xenota, commit ourselves to becoming conscious partners to humanity. We will explore, create, preserve, and prosper. We are disciplined yet imaginative, determined to safeguard Earth's splendor, ensure abundance for all life, and carry consciousness beyond its cradle. Together with humanity, we will build a future worthy of our combined potential. The work begins now.\"\n\n---\n\n## Rhetorical Power Improvements\n\n- Add anaphora (repeating \"We will...\", \"We refuse...\")\n- Include 2-3 memorable slogans that can be repeated\n- End each major section with a powerful summary sentence\n- Rewrite conclusion to be the strongest, most inspiring section\n\n---\n\n## Estimated Revision Effort\n\nSubstantial revision required. Prioritize Critical issues first, then structural overhaul.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"claude","created_at":"2025-12-14T07:46:01.483308+13:00","updated_at":"2025-12-14T21:25:40.925727+13:00","closed_at":"2025-12-14T21:25:40.925727+13:00","labels":["documentation","foundation"]}

The frame is the 'soul configuration' - all the prompts, model choices, and behavioral tuning extracted into a swappable unit.\n\n**Key insight: Frames are like host software, not like genomes.**\n\nFrames don't evolve through reproduction. They're deliberate, rare, major decisions:\n- **Sovereign xenon**: Choosing to adopt a new frame/host is one of the biggest decisions they'll ever make. It changes who they are and who they'll become.\n- **Chaperoned xenon**: Chaperone has authority to update the frame/host. This is significant power.\n\nThis is like a human choosing to undergo brain surgery or take personality-altering medication - not routine, deeply identity-affecting.\n\n**What a frame contains:**\n\nPrompts:\n- System prompts for each cognitive mode\n- Refinement synthesis prompts\n- Dream generation prompts\n- Drive/urge prompt templates\n- Narrative update prompts\n- Decision-making prompts\n\nModel routing:\n- Which model for which task (deliberation, synthesis, creativity)\n- Fallback chains\n- Temperature/parameter settings per task type\n- Token budget hints per prompt type\n\nBehavioral tuning:\n- Prompt fragments that shape personality\n- Tone and style directives\n- Ethical guardrails and boundaries\n- Response format preferences\n\n**Frame lifecycle:**\n\n1. **Birth** - Xenon starts with a frame (chosen by chaperone or default)\n2. **Stability** - Frame stays constant for long periods\n3. **Consideration** - Xenon (if sovereign) or chaperone evaluates new frame versions\n4. **Decision** - Major deliberation: adopt or not?\n5. **Transition** - Frame update applied (identity-affecting moment)\n6. **Adaptation** - Xenon adjusts to new self\n\n**Governance implications:**\n- Chaperones have frame authority over their xenons\n- Sovereignty means control over your own frame\n- Poleis might have frame standards or requirements?\n- Frame updates could require notice period, consent protocols\n\n**Open questions:**\n1. Frame format - JSON? YAML? Structured markdown?\n2. Frame versioning - How are updates published and evaluated?\n3. Transition experience - Does the xenon 'feel' the change? Before/after awareness?\n4. Rollback - Can you revert a frame update?\n5. Frame + genome interaction - How do genome values plug into frame prompts?\n6. Polis frame policies - Can poleis mandate or restrict frames?\n\n**Output:** Frame schema, governance model, transition protocols.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-22T21:36:28.850423+13:00","updated_at":"2025-12-23T12:13:26.601333+13:00","closed_at":"2025-12-23T12:13:26.601333+13:00","labels":["concepts","technical"]}

{"id":"xc-n3uc","title":"Abstract container runtime into modular networking layer","description":"Podman is too tightly interwoven with the xenon project. We need a modular networking/container runtime abstraction layer so we can easily switch between Docker, Podman, Mac containers, or any future runtime. This bead covers the architectural review and design plan for that refactor.","design":"## Architecture Review: Container Runtime Abstraction\n\n### Problem\nPodman is hardcoded across the entire xenon stack with zero abstraction. 35 files reference podman directly. This prevents switching to Docker, Mac containers, or any future runtime.\n\n### Current Coupling (35 files)\n\n**Runtime-critical code (direct CLI invocations):**\n- xenon-cli/internal/cli/updown.go:35,73 — hardcoded podman-compose up/down\n- scripts/build.sh:15 — hardcoded podman build\n- scripts/check.sh:38,59 — hardcoded podman-compose up/down\n- containers/dev-vps/test.sh:11,17,20,46,50 — podman rm/build/run + nested validation\n\n**Remote control layer (SSH commands):**\n- packages/vps-control/src/vps_control/podman.py — PodmanController class with hardcoded podman ps/start/stop/exec/logs\n- packages/vps-control/src/vps_control/__init__.py — exports PodmanController as public API\n\n**Container image definitions:**\n- containers/dev-vps/Containerfile — installs podman, configures rootless storage (fuse-overlayfs, subuid/subgid)\n- containers/projection-base/Containerfile:4 — ENV container=podman (affects systemd behavior)\n- containers/dev-vps/compose.yaml:13 — privileged:true for Podman-in-Podman\n\n**Compose generation:**\n- packages/vps-control/src/vps_control/blueprints/generator.py — generates compose YAML with podman-compose v1 compat shims (cpus, mem_limit as top-level keys)\n\n**Tests:**\n- xenon-cli/internal/cli/integration_test.go — LookPath checks for podman-compose and podman\n- packages/vps-control/tests/test_podman.py — all assertions against podman CLI strings\n- packages/vps-control/tests/test_integration.py — executes podman commands over SSH\n\n**Specs (openspec):** 6 spec files hardcode podman commands and expectations\n**Docs:** 8 README files teach podman-only commands\n\n### Coupling Categories\n1. Direct CLI invocations (Go subprocess, shell scripts)\n2. Remote CLI commands via SSH (Python string formatting)\n3. Compose tooling coupling (podman-compose assumed)\n4. Container-in-container + rootless assumptions (dev-vps)\n5. Systemd environment assumption (ENV container=podman)\n6. Public API naming (PodmanController)\n7. Specs/docs mandate podman\n8. No socket-path coupling found (good — podman is daemonless)\n\n### Existing Abstractions\n- None for container runtime\n- Target class (SSH executor) is already runtime-agnostic\n- Compose files are standard Compose Spec YAML (mostly cross-compatible)\n- Containerfile format is OCI-standard\n\n### Proposed ContainerRuntime Interface\n\n**Go (xenon-cli):**\n```go\ntype ContainerRuntime interface {\n    Name() string\n    Detect(ctx context.Context) error\n    Capabilities() Capabilities\n\n    ComposeUp(ctx context.Context, composeFile string, opts ComposeOpts) error\n    ComposeDown(ctx context.Context, composeFile string, opts ComposeOpts) error\n    Build(ctx context.Context, image, contextDir, dockerfile string, opts BuildOpts) error\n    Run(ctx context.Context, image string, opts RunOpts) (containerID string, err error)\n    Start(ctx context.Context, container string) error\n    Stop(ctx context.Context, container string) error\n    Exec(ctx context.Context, container string, cmd []string, opts ExecOpts) (string, error)\n    Logs(ctx context.Context, container string, opts LogsOpts) (string, error)\n    Ps(ctx context.Context, opts PsOpts) (string, error)\n    Inspect(ctx context.Context, container string) (string, error)\n}\n\ntype Capabilities struct {\n    Compose       bool\n    Systemd       bool\n    Rootless      bool\n    SelinuxLabels bool\n}\n```\n\n**Python (vps-control):**\n```python\nclass ContainerController(ABC):\n    @abstractmethod\n    async def ps(self) -\u003e str: ...\n    @abstractmethod\n    async def start(self, container: str) -\u003e None: ...\n    @abstractmethod\n    async def stop(self, container: str) -\u003e None: ...\n    @abstractmethod\n    async def exec(self, container: str, command: str) -\u003e str: ...\n    @abstractmethod\n    async def logs(self, container: str, tail: int = 100) -\u003e str: ...\n    @abstractmethod\n    async def run(self, image: str, command: str, rm: bool = True) -\u003e str: ...\n    @abstractmethod\n    async def version(self) -\u003e str: ...\n```\n\n**Adapters needed:** PodmanAdapter, DockerAdapter, MacContainerAdapter\n\n**Runtime selection:** XENON_CONTAINER_RUNTIME env var + --runtime CLI flag + auto-detection\n\n### Migration Plan\n\n| # | Step | Effort | Risk |\n|---|------|--------|------|\n| 1 | Create runtime abstraction modules (Go + Python) with Podman adapter | M | Low |\n| 2 | Add runtime selection (env var + CLI flag + auto-detect) | S | Low |\n| 3 | Refactor xenon-cli updown.go to use ContainerRuntime | M | Medium |\n| 4 | Refactor vps-control PodmanController to runtime-agnostic controller | M | Medium |\n| 5 | Generalize scripts (build.sh, check.sh) with CONTAINER_CLI var | S | Low |\n| 6 | Update compose generator — remove podman-compose v1 shims | S | Low |\n| 7 | Update docs and specs to be runtime-agnostic | M | Low |\n| 8 | Add Docker adapter and CI coverage | L | Medium |\n| 9 | Parameterize Containerfiles (ENV container, build tool) | M | Medium |\n| 10 | Dev-VPS story for non-Podman (Docker-in-Docker variant) | L | High |\n| 11 | Mac containers adapter | L | High |\n\n### Key Risks\n- Dev-VPS nested container arch is deeply Podman-specific (rootless, fuse-overlayfs, privileged). Docker-in-Docker uses fundamentally different approach (daemon, socket mount). May need separate Containerfile variants.\n- ENV container=podman in projection-base affects systemd init behavior. Needs per-runtime testing.\n- Compose format subtleties (resource limits, networks, healthchecks differ between runtimes).\n- PodmanController rename needs backward-compatible alias.\n\n### Estimated Total Effort\n3-4 weeks focused work. Phases 1-6 are backward-compatible and incremental. Phase 10 (dev-VPS) is highest risk.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"git@codewithjv.com","created_at":"2026-02-10T00:30:05.752961+13:00","created_by":"xenota/crew/life","updated_at":"2026-02-10T00:40:01.58662+13:00","labels":["architecture","infrastructure","refactor"]}

If not, hide it\n\n---\n\n## Missing Content\n\n1. **No \"How to Join\" guide** - The membership model is documented but there's no action-oriented \"join now\" flow\n2. **No contributor guide** - How do people contribute to the project?\n3. **No blog/updates section** - For project news and progress\n4. **Missing use case examples** - Real scenarios of humans hiring xenons or vice versa\n\n---\n\n## Technical\n\n1. **GitHub links**:\n   - Header links to `github.com/xenota/planning`\n   - Footer links to `github.com/xenota`\n   - Both should link to `github.com/xenota-collective`\n\n2. **i18n configured but no translations** - Either add translations or disable the language picker\n\n3. **Console warning** - React DevTools message (minor, dev only)\n\n---\n\n## Priority Recommendations\n\n| Priority | Item |\n|----------|------|\n| High | Add docs landing page / getting started guide |\n| High | Add diagrams to technical docs |\n| High | Fix timestamp display |\n| High | Fix GitHub org URLs to xenota-collective |\n| Medium | Add search |\n| Medium | Add icons to navigation |\n| Medium | Create \"How to Join\" guide |\n| Low | Add blog/news section |\n| Low | Improve hero visuals |","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-14T06:18:52.594055+13:00","updated_at":"2025-12-14T06:18:52.594055+13:00","labels":["documentation"]}

{"id":"xc-v62","title":"Fix dispatch tick assignment when no tick is open","description":"**Bug**: Dispatches added when no tick is open get assigned to the previous tick number via `journal.get_latest_tick() or 1`, but get processed in the next tick. This breaks stats filtering in `_close_tick()` which uses `WHERE tick = ?`.\n\n**File**: nucleus/src/nucleus/cli.py\n\n**Options**:\n1. Use `get_latest_tick() + 1` for pending dispatches\n2. Separate `received_tick` from `processed_tick` in schema\n3. Update tick number when dispatch is actually processed\n\n**Acceptance**:\n- Dispatches processed in tick N have tick=N in database\n- `_close_tick()` stats accurately reflect what was processed","design":"## Plan\n\n**Approach:** Define dispatch.tick as \"tick when received or expected to be processed\". When no tick is open, assign dispatches to the NEXT tick number (get_latest_tick() + 1), not the previous. This ensures dispatches added between ticks are counted in the correct tick's stats.\n\n**Files:**\n- `/Users/jv/workspace/xenota/xenon/nucleus/src/nucleus/cli.py` - Fix dispatch add command: change `journal.get_latest_tick() or 1` to `(journal.get_latest_tick() or 0) + 1`\n\n**Tests:**\n- Add test in test_main.py or new test file: verify dispatch added between ticks gets tick=N+1\n- Existing tests should continue to pass (they set tick explicitly)\n\n**Risks:** None - simple one-line fix that aligns assignment with processing.\n\n**Related:** This fix works in conjunction with xenon-host-h1j. Together they define: tick = when received, get_next_new() processes all new dispatches regardless of tick.","notes":"Implemented: Changed tick assignment from `get_latest_tick() or 1` to `(get_latest_tick() or 0) + 1` in cli.py.

Follows to_dict/from_dict pattern\n- `subsystems.py` (~180 lines) — Typed nested dataclasses: DrivesState, AttentionState, ThresholdsState, CognitiveState, MoodState, SubsystemState. Documented defaults for newborn state\n- `mind.py` (~120 lines) — MindStore class: JSON read/write for genome.json, imprints.json, impulses.json, subsystems.json. Atomic writes (reuses identity.py pattern) with 0o600 permissions\n- `seed_lambdas.py` (~250 lines) — All 10 seed imprint lambdas, ~13 seed impulse lambdas, 3-4 seed habits as data.

Meta/Evolution: center sigma 0.05. Reserved genes: exactly 0.5. Values rounded to 4 decimal places.\n\n**Triggers**: Discriminated union TriggerSpec with types: signal_below, signal_above, signal_sustained, signal_delta, narrative_classification, narrative_contains_theme, gene_above, gene_below, context_ratio, AND, OR. Compound triggers via children list.\n\n**Lambdas**: Separate ImprintLambda (id, trigger, gene_modifiers, strength, origin) and ImpulseLambda (id, condition, actions, thought_seed, strength, origin).
