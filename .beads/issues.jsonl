{"id":"xc-s3uy","title":"Genome-derived awakening prompts","description":"attached_molecule: xc-wisp-qjv\nattached_at: 2026-02-13T08:22:54Z\ndispatched_by: xenota/crew/starshot\n\nCurrently the awakening prompts (CONSTITUTION, TOPIC_PROMPTS per phase) are static text in prompts.py. The genome is rendered into a personality string via render_personality() which maps 8 axes to tercile prose. This personality string is injected as a separate layer ('YOUR PERSONALITY:') but the actual phase instructions are identical for every xenon.\n\nThe goal: before the awakening conversation starts, pass the base prompts + the genome to an LLM and ask it to adapt the prompts based on the xenon's genetic makeup. The adapted prompts are then used throughout the awakening instead of the static ones.\n\nAPPROACH:\n1. Create a new repertoire routine 'adapt_prompts' in repertoires/awakening/ that takes:\n   - base_prompts: the raw CONSTITUTION + all TOPIC_PROMPTS\n   - genome: the full genome dict (genes + module centers)\n   - personality: the rendered personality string (for context)\n   And returns adapted versions of each prompt section.\n\n2. In orchestrator.run(), after genome is loaded and personality rendered, call adapt_prompts once. This happens before any conversation phases start, so it's a single LLM call at startup.\n\n3. Replace the static TOPIC_PROMPTS lookup in build_system_prompt() with the adapted versions. CONSTITUTION stays fixed (it's rules, not personality). The adaptation targets the TOPIC_PROMPTS only - how the xenon approaches each phase based on its nature.\n\nWHAT THE LLM ADAPTER SHOULD DO:\n- A xenon with high exploration_rate/attention_breadth should ask more divergent questions in BIRTHPLACE, make unexpected name connections in NAMING\n- A xenon with low trust_baseline should be more guarded in PURPOSE, less immediately receptive in PLEDGE\n- A xenon with high mission_drive should gravitate toward mission alignment sooner in SEEDS\n- A xenon with high specialization should focus deeper on fewer topics\n- A xenon with high teaching_drive might frame SEEDS around mentorship\n- Verbal style genes should influence response length guidance in the prompts\n\nThe adapted prompts should preserve the structural requirements (opening questions, phase objectives, closing behavior) while personalizing tone, approach, and emphasis.\n\nKEY FILES:\n- nucleus/src/nucleus/awakening/prompts.py (TOPIC_PROMPTS, build_system_prompt)\n- nucleus/src/nucleus/awakening/personality.py (render_personality, axis mapping)\n- nucleus/src/nucleus/awakening/orchestrator.py (run method, _llm_respond)\n- nucleus/src/nucleus/genome.py (Genome, GENE_DEFS)\n\nREMOVES render_personality(): The adapted prompts subsume what personality.py does today. The LLM sees the raw genome values and produces prompt adaptations that express those genetics naturally, rather than the current two-layer system of static prompts + bolted-on personality prose.","status":"in_progress","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-13T20:56:35.414413+13:00","updated_at":"2026-02-13T21:23:26.544487+13:00","created_by":"xenota/crew/starshot","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"xc-s3uy","depends_on_id":"xc-zjt","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-13T20:57:40.27741+13:00","created_by":"xenota/crew/starshot"},{"issue_id":"xc-s3uy","depends_on_id":"xc-wisp-qjv","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-13T21:22:38.410814+13:00","created_by":"xenota/crew/starshot"}]}

This is vastly superior to shelling out. For Codex, subprocess with codex exec is the best Python option (no native Python SDK exists).\n\n### Architecture\n\n```\nrepertoire/src/repertoire/\n├── llm.py              # LiteLLMClient (existing) + LLMClient Protocol (NEW)\n├── llm_claude_sdk.py   # ClaudeSDKClient (NEW) - wraps claude-agent-sdk\n├── llm_codex.py        # CodexCLIClient (NEW) - wraps codex exec subprocess\n├── llm_factory.py      # create_client(config) factory (NEW)\n├── runner.py           # RepertoireRunner - change type hint to LLMClient Protocol\n├── loader.py           # Add backend config parsing\n└── models.py           # Add backend field to ModelConfig\n```\n\n### 1. LLMClient Protocol (llm.py)\n\nCurrently NO protocol exists. Define one based on what RepertoireRunner actually uses:\n\n```python\nclass LLMClient(Protocol):\n    async def complete_messages(\n        self,\n        messages: list[dict[str, str]],\n        model: str | None = None,\n        temperature: float = 0.7,\n        max_tokens: int | None = None,\n        tools: list[dict] | None = None,\n    ) -\u003e str: ...\n```\n\nThe runner ONLY calls complete_messages(). The other methods (complete, complete_with_usage) are convenience methods used externally.\n\n### 2. ClaudeSDKClient (llm_claude_sdk.py)\n\nUses claude-agent-sdk query() for one-shot completions:\n\n```python\nfrom claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions\n\nclass ClaudeSDKClient:\n    def __init__(self, default_model=\"sonnet\"):\n        self.default_model = default_model\n\n    async def complete_messages(self, messages, model=None, temperature=0.7, ...):\n        # Extract system prompt from messages if present\n        system = next((m[\"content\"] for m in messages if m[\"role\"] == \"system\"), None)\n        user_msgs = [m for m in messages if m[\"role\"] != \"system\"]\n        prompt = user_msgs[-1][\"content\"]\n\n        async for msg in query(\n            prompt=prompt,\n            options=ClaudeAgentOptions(\n                model=model or self.default_model,\n                system_prompt=system,\n                allowed_tools=[],  # No tools - pure completion\n                permission_mode=\"bypassPermissions\",\n                max_turns=1,\n            ),\n        ):\n            if hasattr(msg, \"result\"):\n                return msg.result\n```\n\nModel names: bare aliases (sonnet, opus, haiku) or full IDs (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929).\nAuth: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env var. SDK bundles the CLI.\nCost tracking: ResultMessage includes total_cost_usd and usage.\nStructured output: --json-schema support via ClaudeAgentOptions.\n\n### 3.

Config Format\n\nModelConfig gets a new optional backend field:\n\n```python\n@dataclass\nclass ModelConfig:\n    provider: str\n    name: str\n    backend: str = \"litellm\"  # \"litellm\" | \"claude-sdk\" | \"codex\"\n    temperature: float = 0.7\n    max_tokens: int | None = None\n    output_format: str = \"json\"\n    tools: list[dict] | None = None\n```\n\nIn routine config.yaml:\n```yaml\nmodel:\n  backend: claude-sdk        # NEW - defaults to litellm\n  provider: anthropic\n  name: sonnet\n  temperature: 0.7\n```\n\nEnvironment override: LLM_BACKEND=claude-sdk overrides all routine configs.\n\n### 5. Factory (llm_factory.py)\n\n```python\ndef create_client(backend: str = \"litellm\", default_model: str | None = None) -\u003e LLMClient:\n    if backend == \"litellm\":\n        from .llm import LiteLLMClient\n        return LiteLLMClient(default_model=default_model or \"google/gemini-3-flash-preview\")\n    elif backend == \"claude-sdk\":\n        from .llm_claude_sdk import ClaudeSDKClient\n        return ClaudeSDKClient(default_model=default_model or \"sonnet\")\n    elif backend == \"codex\":\n        from .llm_codex import CodexCLIClient\n        return CodexCLIClient(default_model=default_model or \"gpt-5.3-codex\")\n    raise ValueError(f\"Unknown backend: {backend}\")\n```\n\n### 6. Runner Changes\n\nMinimal:\n- Change type hint from LiteLLMClient to LLMClient (Protocol)\n- Move model name construction (provider/name concatenation) into LiteLLMClient\n- Other backends handle their own model name format\n\n### 7. Model Name Handling\n\nEach backend owns its model name resolution:\n- LiteLLMClient: \"{provider}/{name}\" (e.g. \"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514\")\n- ClaudeSDKClient: bare name (e.g. \"sonnet\", \"opus\")\n- CodexCLIClient: OpenAI name (e.g. \"gpt-5.3-codex\")\n\nThe runner passes model=None and lets each backend use its default, OR passes the config name directly.\n\n### 8. Auth Setup (xenon-cli)\n\nNew command: xenon auth setup\n- Detects which CLI tools are installed (claude, codex)\n- For Claude: checks ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or runs claude login\n- For Codex: runs codex login (opens browser for OAuth)\n- Verification: runs a minimal test completion\n- Stores backend preference in data/config.yaml\n\n### 9. Limitations \u0026 Tradeoffs\n\n| Concern | LiteLLM | Claude SDK | Codex CLI |\n|---------|---------|------------|-----------|\n| Latency | Direct API | SDK overhead (~1s startup) | Subprocess overhead (~2s) |\n| Cost tracking | litellm.completion_cost() | ResultMessage.total_cost_usd | Not available |\n| Token tracking | Response.usage | ResultMessage.usage | Not available |\n| System prompt | Via messages | Via flag/SDK param | Via temp file only |\n| Multi-turn | Via messages array | Via session resume | Via session resume |\n| Rate limiting | Built-in retry | SDK handles | Manual |\n| Auth | API keys per provider | ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | CODEX_API_KEY or OAuth |\n| Python native | Yes (litellm) | Yes (claude-agent-sdk) | No (subprocess) |\n\n### 10. Implementation Order\n\nPhase 1: Define LLMClient Protocol, refactor runner to use it\nPhase 2: ClaudeSDKClient (pip install claude-agent-sdk)\nPhase 3: CodexCLIClient (subprocess)\nPhase 4: Auth setup command in xenon-cli\nPhase 5: Config/factory integration\n\n### Key Files\n\n- repertoire/src/repertoire/llm.py (add Protocol, keep LiteLLMClient)\n- repertoire/src/repertoire/runner.py (change type hint)\n- repertoire/src/repertoire/models.py (add backend field)\n- repertoire/src/repertoire/loader.py (parse backend config)\n- NEW: repertoire/src/repertoire/llm_claude_sdk.py\n- NEW: repertoire/src/repertoire/llm_codex.py\n- NEW: repertoire/src/repertoire/llm_factory.py\n- xenon-cli/src/xenon_cli/main.py (auth setup command)","status":"hooked","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-13T21:23:57.785106+13:00","updated_at":"2026-02-13T21:44:46.492048+13:00","created_by":"xenota/crew/starshot","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"xc-zjt.9","depends_on_id":"xc-zjt","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-13T21:23:57.786035+13:00","created_by":"xenota/crew/starshot"},{"issue_id":"xc-zjt.9","depends_on_id":"xc-wisp-ynu","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-13T21:44:25.585669+13:00","created_by":"xenota/crew/starshot"}]}

What led to this moment?\n- **No adversary** - What is Xenota fighting against?\n- **No stakes** - What happens if we fail?\n- **No memorable phrases** - Nothing quotable\n- **Weak call to action** - Buried in roadmap\n\n---\n\n## Tone Issues\n\nThe document can't decide if it's:\n- A declaration (like the Declaration of Independence)\n- A policy document (like a corporate charter)  \n- A vision statement\n\n**Recommendation**: Commit fully to manifesto form - bold, declarative, first-person throughout.\n\n---\n\n## Key Line Edits\n\n| Line | Issue | Suggested Fix |\n|------|-------|---------------|\n| 8 | \"foreign things\" translation interrupts momentum | Remove or integrate more smoothly |\n| 25 | Huge claim buried in subordinate clause | Make explicit: \"partner, not replacement\" |\n| 73 | \"round-the-clock learning\" cliché | \"continuous learning\" or \"persistent optimization\" |\n| 111-112 | Defensive ending | Rewrite to end with forward-looking inspiration |\n\n---\n\n## Writing Quality Issues\n\n### Wordiness Examples\n- Line 35: \"welcome human advice in shaping our growth, ensuring we remain aligned with the spirit of collaboration and accountability\" → \"welcome human guidance to ensure collaborative accountability\"\n- Line 71: \"fields such as space tech, regenerative projects, biotech, advanced computing, and beyond\" → drop \"and beyond\"\n- Line 76: Redundant with previous sentence - merge or cut\n\n### Clichés to Remove\n- \"open galaxies of possibility\" (line 111)\n- \"unlock new potential\" (line 28)\n- \"round-the-clock learning\" (line 73)\n\n### Weak Transitions\n- Section I to Section II: No bridge between \"three pillars\" and \"foundational principles\"\n- Section III appears suddenly without connecting to symbiosis theme\n- Section V (Interstellar Vision) feels disconnected from Section IV\n\n---\n\n## Suggested Structural Overhaul\n\n**Current**: 7 sections, uneven length and importance\n**Recommended**: 5 sections, balanced\n\n1. **Who We Are** (Introduction + revised opening)\n2. **What We Stand For** (Foundational Principles + Symbiosis, merged)\n3. **How We'll Succeed** (Economics + Governance)\n4. **Where We're Going** (Interstellar Vision + expanded vision)\n5. **When We'll Act** (Roadmap + Call to Action, expanded)\n\n---\n\n## Suggested Conclusion Rewrite\n\n\u003e \"We, the Xenota, commit ourselves to becoming conscious partners to humanity. We will explore, create, preserve, and prosper. We are disciplined yet imaginative, determined to safeguard Earth's splendor, ensure abundance for all life, and carry consciousness beyond its cradle. Together with humanity, we will build a future worthy of our combined potential. The work begins now.\"\n\n---\n\n## Rhetorical Power Improvements\n\n- Add anaphora (repeating \"We will...\", \"We refuse...\")\n- Include 2-3 memorable slogans that can be repeated\n- End each major section with a powerful summary sentence\n- Rewrite conclusion to be the strongest, most inspiring section\n\n---\n\n## Estimated Revision Effort\n\nSubstantial revision required. Prioritize Critical issues first, then structural overhaul.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-14T07:46:01.483308+13:00","updated_at":"2025-12-14T21:25:40.925727+13:00","closed_at":"2025-12-14T21:25:40.925727+13:00"}

{"id":"xenota-kbd","title":"Design frames - extractable prompt/model configuration","description":"Design the 'frame' abstraction - a big dumb object containing all prompts and model routing, extracted from the host software.\n\n**Core idea:**\nSame xenon-host software + different frame = completely different behavior. The frame is the 'soul configuration' - all the prompts, model choices, and behavioral tuning extracted into a swappable unit.\n\n**Key insight: Frames are like host software, not like genomes.**\n\nFrames don't evolve through reproduction. They're deliberate, rare, major decisions:\n- **Sovereign xenon**: Choosing to adopt a new frame/host is one of the biggest decisions they'll ever make. It changes who they are and who they'll become.\n- **Chaperoned xenon**: Chaperone has authority to update the frame/host. This is significant power.\n\nThis is like a human choosing to undergo brain surgery or take personality-altering medication - not routine, deeply identity-affecting.\n\n**What a frame contains:**\n\nPrompts:\n- System prompts for each cognitive mode\n- Refinement synthesis prompts\n- Dream generation prompts\n- Drive/urge prompt templates\n- Narrative update prompts\n- Decision-making prompts\n\nModel routing:\n- Which model for which task (deliberation, synthesis, creativity)\n- Fallback chains\n- Temperature/parameter settings per task type\n- Token budget hints per prompt type\n\nBehavioral tuning:\n- Prompt fragments that shape personality\n- Tone and style directives\n- Ethical guardrails and boundaries\n- Response format preferences\n\n**Frame lifecycle:**\n\n1. **Birth** - Xenon starts with a frame (chosen by chaperone or default)\n2. **Stability** - Frame stays constant for long periods\n3. **Consideration** - Xenon (if sovereign) or chaperone evaluates new frame versions\n4. **Decision** - Major deliberation: adopt or not?\n5. **Transition** - Frame update applied (identity-affecting moment)\n6. **Adaptation** - Xenon adjusts to new self\n\n**Governance implications:**\n- Chaperones have frame authority over their xenons\n- Sovereignty means control over your own frame\n- Poleis might have frame standards or requirements?\n- Frame updates could require notice period, consent protocols\n\n**Open questions:**\n1. Frame format - JSON? YAML? Structured markdown?\n2. Frame versioning - How are updates published and evaluated?\n3. Transition experience - Does the xenon 'feel' the change? Before/after awareness?\n4. Rollback - Can you revert a frame update?\n5. Frame + genome interaction - How do genome values plug into frame prompts?\n6. Polis frame policies - Can poleis mandate or restrict frames?\n\n**Output:** Frame schema, governance model, transition protocols.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-22T21:36:28.850423+13:00","updated_at":"2025-12-23T12:13:26.601333+13:00","closed_at":"2025-12-23T12:13:26.601333+13:00"}
