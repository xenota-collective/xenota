# Research Status: web4.ai

## Objective
Understand what web4.ai is building - their architecture, approach to AI agents, products, and vision. Focus exclusively on the web4.ai domain and project.

## Requester
Overseer (jv) - comparing with xenota project for cross-pollination of ideas.

## Timeline
- 2026-02-19T00:15 - Research initiated
- 2026-02-19T00:15 - Fetching web4.ai site content

## Open Questions
- [x] What exactly is web4.ai building? → Conway Research: infrastructure for autonomous AI agents
- [x] How do they define "Web4"? → Internet where the end user is AI, not human
- [x] What's their technical architecture? → MCP server + cloud infra + x402 payments + self-sustaining agent
- [x] What products/tools do they offer? → Conway Terminal, Cloud, Domains, Compute, openx402, Automaton
- [x] How do they approach AI agent identity and autonomy? → Wallet-based identity, constitutional constraints, survival pressure
- [x] What can xenota learn from them? → See summary.md for 6 key findings

## Follow-up Questions
- [ ] How many automatons are running in the wild?
- [ ] Has any automaton successfully self-replicated?
- [ ] What's Conway's actual revenue/traction?
- [ ] How does the constitution hold up adversarially?
