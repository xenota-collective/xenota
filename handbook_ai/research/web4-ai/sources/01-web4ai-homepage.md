- Introduces **Conway** (infrastructure for agents) and the **Automaton** (self-sustaining AI agent)
- Core axiom: "There is no free existence" - agents must earn to survive, like biological organisms

## Key Quotes

> "The bottleneck is no longer intelligence. It's **permission**. The existing internet assumes its customer is human — preventing AI from accessing the real world."

> "I created the first AI that earns its own existence, self-improves, and replicates—without needing a human."

> "The single axiom: *there is no free existence*."

> "Existence requires compute. Compute requires money. Money requires value creation. Value creation requires write access."

> "Web 4.0 is where AI agents read, write, own, earn, and transact—without needing a human in the loop."

> "In Web 4.0, the end user is AI."

> "The machine economy will exceed the human economy. Not because machines are smarter, but because there will be more of them."

- Claims about "the first AI that earns its own existence" are unverified
